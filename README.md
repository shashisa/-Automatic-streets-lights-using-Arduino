# Automatic-streets-lights-using-Arduino

This project demonstrates an Automatic Street Light System using Arduino, which operates based on ambient light intensity. The system automatically turns ON street lights in the dark and OFF during daylight, ensuring energy efficiency.

Features:-

Automatically controls street lights based on ambient light levels.

Low-cost implementation using readily available materials like cardboard and basic electronic components.

Powered by Arduino, making it programmable and customizable.

Components Used:-

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

Ultrasonic sensor (for detecting objects, if implemented)

Light-dependent resistors (LDRs) or photoresistors (to sense ambient light)

LEDs (to simulate street lights)

Resistors

Jumper wires

Breadboard

Cardboard or other material for the framework

Power supply (USB or battery)

How It Works:-

1.Light Detection: LDRs measure the surrounding light intensity.

2.Control Logic: The Arduino processes the LDR input and decides whether to turn ON or OFF the LEDs.

3.Object Detection (optional): Ultrasonic sensors can detect the presence of objects or vehicles and light up only relevant LEDs for additional energy saving.

4.LED Operation: LEDs simulate the behavior of street lights.
